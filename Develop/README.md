## description
 i made this project to make creating a readme file easier
 this project solves the problem of making sure you have a professional read me file with your code and in your github
 In making this project I learned how to better use node and create files with it. I also became much more familer with the inquiere package and how to set it up for use

## Installation
  to install this app you will need to copy in the package.json, index.js, and generateMarkdone.js files

## usage
  to use this program once you have copied over the files you need to opena new terminal and do an npm install to bring in the required packages. after that run node index.js and answer the propmts. once you have answered all the prompts it will create a readme file for you and you can edit if you need to.
